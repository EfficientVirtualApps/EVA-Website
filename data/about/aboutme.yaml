  title: "BACKGROUND & STORY"
  text: |
    My name is Christopher DeReinzi, and I graduated Lamar University as a B.B.A. In Management Information Systems focusing in Business Analytics. In addition to my Lamar background, I branched out on my own to learn about Microsoft Azure, static and dynamic website design, and a suite of other skills and software.

    EVA was then founded with the knowledge I had acquired and practiced in order to bring the power of big tech to small and medium business in the Beaumont, Lumberton, and Greater SETX area.
